# MachineLearningStudy

Study using a Neural Net with Keras. 

Usage: "python Main2.py [SystName] [Campaign] [Odd/Even]"
 e.g. python Main2.py nominal MC16a Odd

In SubmitJobs directory: Submit scripts to distribute the systematics with condor_submit

Question was: Can the Matrix element method result be improved by combining the event likelihoods with a neural net?
Result: No, Neural net only reproduced the MEM discriminant
